						Namaste and Welcome to my Website!!<br>I am currently a
						senior at Smithtown High School West, in Smithtown, Long Island. I
						have been studying music since I was four years old and hope to
						continue my musical journey in the years to come.

					<p>
						<b>About me:</b><br>I was born on October 23, 1996 in Dubai,
						United Arab Emirates. Currently, I am an 11th grader at Smithtown
						High School West in Smithtown, Long Island. My passion for music
						was recognized during my early childhood by my parents, Anup and
						Manisha Varshney. I started my musical training at the tender age
						of four under local teachers and musicians. After relocating to
						the United States, in 2004, I joined the Raga School of Music in
						Hicksville, New York. There, I started my training in North Indian
						classical singing under Bhajan Samrat Shri Kumar Raj Gandharav.
						Under the guidance and patronage of my Guru, I have recorded my
						debut Bhajan album. I dedicate this album, “Bhajan Prabhat”, to my
						grandfather, late Shri Prabhat Kumar Varshney. I have performed in
						many concerts at the Shri Ram Sharnam Temple, the Hindu Community
						Center and Shri Hanuman Mandir. In addition to singing, I am a
						fine violinist and lead my school's orchestral performances as
						concert mistress. Presently, I am learning under Lisa Polito. I
						have participated in the Long Island String Festival
						Association(LISFA) and Suffolk County Music Educator’s
						Association(SCMEA) several times. I have also learnt Bharatnatyam,
						an Indian classical dance, under Guru Smt. Satya Pradeep.

						<b>My Performances:</b><br>On October 30, 2010, I released my
						debut Bhajan album, “Bhajan Prabhat”, in honor of my grandfather,
						late Shri Prabhat Kumar Varshney. To commemorate my achievement, I
						performed live at my Bhajan Sandhya. At my Bhajan Sandhya, I sang
						some of my favorite Bhajans, which was followed by a CD releasing
						ceremony. In addition, my Guru, Bhajan Samrat Shri Kumar Raj
						Gandharav, sang some Bhajans as well. To conclude my concert, I
						performed a fusion of “Sare Jahan Se Aacha” and "Jana Gana Mana,"
						the national anthem of India, on my violin and then sang the
						Aarti.
